## 🧩 Problem Overview

The **Train Single-Routing Selection Problem (TSRSP)** arises in the context of real-time railway traffic management. It consists in selecting exactly one feasible route per train from a predefined set of alternatives, in such a way that:

- The total cost — including route-specific delays and delay-induced penalties from route interactions — is minimized;
- All selected routes are pairwise compatible.

This problem can be modeled as the search for a minimum-weight **k-clique** in a **k-partite compatibility graph**, where each vertex represents a route and each layer corresponds to a train. Compatibility is encoded by edges between vertices of distinct layers, with associated pairwise (pairing) costs.

In the referenced article, we:
- Introduce a novel and effective MILP formulation based on a compact linearization of a Binary Quadratic Programming (BQP) model;
- Propose a strengthening of the LP relaxation tailored to the TSRSP structure;
- Perform a detailed theoretical and computational comparison against existing formulations;
- Present the first optimal solutions for large-scale real-world instances of the TSRSP.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following main folders:

- [`data/`](./data/) — Contains all **benchmark instances** used in the computational experiments, including instance statistics and detailed descriptions of the input formats and directory structure for the **Rouen** and **Lille** railway networks.

- [`results/`](./results/) — Contains the **computational results** obtained for the tested formulations, includin CPU time and optimality gap distributions, and performance profiles for the **Rouen** railway networks. A summary of computational results for all instances and formulations is also available as an Excel file.

Each folder contains its own `README.md` file with further details.
