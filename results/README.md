## üïí CPU Time Results for TSRSP Formulations


## ‚è≥ Time Limit

All experiments were run with a maximum solution time of **300 seconds** per instance.

### üìà CPU Time Distributions

The following box plots show the distribution of CPU times (in seconds) for all tested formulations, grouped by edge density levels of the compatibility graph:  
- $\varepsilon = 1.0$  
- $\varepsilon = 0.9$  
- $\varepsilon = 0.8$

Each plot includes the median, interquartile range, and potential outliers, as well as the number of optimally solved instances (``\#opt'') out of 100 per group.

**Observations:**
- The best performance is achieved by formulations $\hat{G}$, $\hat{G}_a$, and $\hat{G}_b$, with consistently low CPU times and narrow distributions.
- Formulation $G$ is also efficient for $\varepsilon = 1$, but its variants degrade in performance with sparser graphs.
- Formulations $GW$, $Q$, and $S$ perform poorly, with CPU times often approaching the 300-second limit.

### üìä Performance Profiles

Following [Dolan and Mor√© (2002)](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/S1064827502417021), the **performance profile** $\rho_f(\tau)$ for a formulation $f$ measures how close its solution times are to the best solver across instances.

Let $t_{i,f}$ be the solution time for instance $i$ with formulation $f$, and $\mathcal{F}$ be the set of all tested formulations:

$$
r_{i,f} = \frac{t_{i,f}}{\min_{f' \in \mathcal{F}} t_{i,f'}} \quad,\quad \rho_f(\tau) = \frac{|\{ i \in \mathcal{I} : r_{i,f} \leq \tau \}|}{|\mathcal{I}|}
$$

The following plots show $\rho_f(\tau)$ for each formulation and edge density level.

</div>

**Highlights:**
- Formulations $\hat{G}$, $\hat{G}_a$, and $\hat{G}_b$ dominate across all $\tau$.
- $G$ is competitive for dense graphs but degrades with sparsity.
- $GW$, $Q$, and $S$ exhibit poor performance and solve fewer instances in acceptable time frames.
